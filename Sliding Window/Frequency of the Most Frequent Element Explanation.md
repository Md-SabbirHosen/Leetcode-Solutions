# Problem: 1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element

## Problem Statement

The frequency of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by 1.

Return the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most `k` operations.

---

### Example 1:
```bash
Input: nums = [1, 2, 4], k = 5
Output: 3
```

Explanation:  
Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make `nums = [4, 4, 4]`.  
The frequency of `4` is 3.

### Example 2:
```bash
Input: nums = [1, 4, 8, 13], k = 5
Output: 2
```

Explanation:  
There are multiple optimal solutions:
- Increment the first element three times to make `nums = [4, 4, 8, 13]`, where `4` has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the second element four times to make `nums = [1, 8, 8, 13]`, where `8` has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the third element five times to make `nums = [1, 4, 13, 13]`, where `13` has a frequency of 2.

### Example 3:
```bash
Input: nums = [3, 9, 6], k = 2
Output: 1
```

Explanation:  
With `k = 2`, it's impossible to increase any number enough times to make two elements the same. So the maximum frequency is 1.

## Solution Overview

### Approach:

1. **Sorting** the array helps by grouping similar numbers together. Once sorted, we can efficiently increase the smaller numbers to match the larger ones.
2. We use a **sliding window technique** to find the largest window of numbers that can be made identical using at most `k` operations.
3. If the number of operations exceeds `k`, we contract the window by moving the left pointer.

### Formula Insight:

For any subarray `[nums[l], nums[l+1], ..., nums[r]]`, we check if we can make all elements equal to `nums[r]` by ensuring:
```bash
nums[r] * (r - l + 1) ≤ total + k
```
Where `total` is the sum of the elements in the current window.

### Algorithm:

1. **Sort the array** `nums`.
2. Use a **sliding window** with two pointers `left` and `right`, both starting at `0`, and a `total` to store the sum of the elements in the current window.
3. Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer.
4. If the current window violates the condition, shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer.
5. Track the maximum window size, which gives the maximum frequency.

## Solution Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequency(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        long long l = 0, r = 0, n = nums.size(), res = 0, total = 0;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        while (r < n) {
            total += nums[r];
            while (nums[r] * (r - l + 1) > total + k) {
                total -= nums[l];
                l++;
            }
            res = max(res, (r - l + 1));
            r++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

---

## Key Steps

1. **Sort the Input**  
   Sorting helps group numbers together, making it easier to handle in the sliding window approach.
   ```cpp
   sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
   ```

2. **Sliding Window**  
   Use two pointers `l` and `r` to define the window. Calculate the total sum of elements in the window and use the formula `nums[r] * (r - l + 1) > total + k` to check if we need to adjust the window.
   ```cpp
   while (r < n) {
       total += nums[r];
       while (nums[r] * (r - l + 1) > total + k) {
           total -= nums[l];
           l++;
       }
       res = max(res, (r - l + 1));
       r++;
   }
   ```

3. **Track Maximum Frequency**  
   Update `res` whenever the current window size (i.e., `r - l + 1`) is larger than the previous maximum.

---

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  
  Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`.  
  The sliding window technique takes `O(n)`, so the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  The space complexity is `O(1)` (not counting the input space).

---

## Conclusion

This sliding window approach efficiently solves the problem by dynamically adjusting the window size and ensuring that the total number of operations performed does not exceed `k`.
